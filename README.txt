Speech Recognition Software
Picked Up project. The speech recognition software makes use of the SpeechRecognition class.
Currently it picks up on sentences and creates paragraph elements once the speaker stops speaking.
The next step is to set up a reply system currently for testing purposes it hard coded with if statements. But that will change in future commits.
A Server is needed to run the recognition system however.
